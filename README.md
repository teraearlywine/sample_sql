# Sample SQL Repository

Hi! Welcome to my Sample SQL Repository! 

The following repo contains samples of SQL code that can be referenced as a portfolio piece by future clients or employers. 

I set this up so that sub-directories are differentiated by their database ontology. Meaning, itâ€™s structured so that database management or operational SQL is differentiated from data modeling.

The primary databases and SQL languages I am most familiar with are MySQL and BigQuery. For all intents and purposes they should be mostly transferrable, but will be sticking to MySQL in the short term.  Additionally, I use numbering to highlight the order in which the queries should be run. 

Additionally, this is meant as a starting point and currently has no functionality unless using MySQL locally and with the CLI. In the future, I may decide to add additional features but we will see.

Happy Exploring! 

Sincerely, 

Tera
