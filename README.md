# Sample SQL Repository

Hi! Welcome to my Sample SQL Repository! 

The following repo contains samples of SQL code that can be referenced as a portfolio piece by future clients or employers. 

I set this up so that sub-directories are differentiated by their database ontology. Meaning, itâ€™s structured so that database management or operational SQL is differentiated from analytical querying. The primary databases and SQL languages I am most familiar with are MySQL and BigQuery. For all intents and purposes they should be mostly transferrable, but will be sticking to MySQL in the short term. 

Additionally, this is meant as a starting point and currently has no functionality unless using MySQL locally and with the CLI. In the future, I may decide to add additional features but we will see.

Happy Exploring! 
Sincerely, 
Tera
